# webpack_react_template
A simple skeleton template for a React application that is built with [Webpack]("https://webpack.js.org/") and [Babel]("https://babeljs.io/")

Used [this]("https://www.valentinog.com/blog/babel/") tutorial as a walkthrough

### Scripts
* `npm run start` starts the app in development mode on `localhost:8080`
* `npm run test` executes tests
* `npm run build` produces a production ready minified build under the `dist` folder

### Extras
* [Jest]("https://jestjs.io/") is the test-runner
* Includes the [`jest-html-reporter`]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-html-reporter") package, which creates an HTML report of any tests executed and adds it to the `testReports` folder.
